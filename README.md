# Speed-Dating

Are the attributes that people say they find important really the driving factors in the end? What factors truly influence a match? In this new age of online dating, physical traits are one of the deciding factors of a right swipe. If we remove dating apps from the equation, does attractiveness really hold so much weight? Are we wasting time focusing on things that don't lead to love? Let's find out.

Two Columbia Business School College professors named Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar led speed dating events from 2002-2004. During these events, participants had four minute first dates with every other participant of the opposite sex.

Participants were asked questions regarding:

- demographics
- lifestyle
- dating habits
- if they'd like to see their date again
- rating their date based off of attributes such as Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests
- self perception across those attributes
- how important each of those attributes are to them
- belief on how much others value those attributes
